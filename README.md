  ### Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and a leading cause of vision loss in adults. It occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision impairment and even blindness if left untreated. Early detection is crucial for managing the progression of this disease.
  
### In this project, we aim to develop a model that can accurately detect diabetic retinopathy using a dataset of fundus images.

  ### the following images are generated from processing fundus images :-
  * vessels
  * microaneursyms
  * exudates

    #### GLCM features are extracted from the previous images type and fed into an svm vinary classifier achieving an accuracy of 88%.
